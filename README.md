# PSYC 575: Exercise 9 (Week 11)

In this exercise, you will practice cloning a GitHub repository, commiting changes, and pushing changes to GitHub. 

## Instructions:

1. Clone this repository
    
    a. In RStudio, select `File` --> `New Project`
    
    b. Select `Version Control`
    
    c. Select `Git`
    
    d. Input the link of this repository, XXX, to "Repository URL." Under "Create project as subdirectory of," click "Browse...," and choose a location in your computer to save the repository.
    
2. You should now have a project named "ex9" opened in RStudio. Follow the instruction in "09-model-avg-github.Rmd."

3. Knit the file "09-model-avg-github.Rmd." It should generate a markdown file "09-model-avg-github.md."

4. Commit changes

    a. When you finish editing and knitting, go to the "Git" panel, check both the .Rmd file and the .md file, and hit commit
    
    b. Type a commit message to describe what you have updated. For example, "Answered questions and generated a markdown output."
    
5. Push changes

    a. Click the `Push` button. If successful, it should upload your work to GitHub.
    
6. To submit your work, copy the link of the repository you updated to Blackboard under Exercise 9. Make sure that you can see the files even after you log out of GitHub.
